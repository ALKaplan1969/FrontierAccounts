# FrontierAccounts

I really wanted to keep the application simple and straight forward. If I were to develop this for a more enterise environment, I would have probably created another folder or project to get the data for the form. Classes would have been in their own folder called MODELS. I probably would have also seperated the the style section into a css class.
